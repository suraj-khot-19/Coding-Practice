Sync in JS
1.Synchronous
    Synchronous means the code runs in a particular sequence of instructions given in the program.
    Each instruction waits for the previous instruction to complete its execution.

2.Asynchronous
    Due to synchronous programming, sometimes imp instructions get
    blocked due to some previous instructions, which causes a delay in the UI.
    Asynchronous code execution allows to execute next instructions
    immediately and doesn't block the flow.
